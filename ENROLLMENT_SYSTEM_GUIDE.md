## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

```
functions/
├── index.js                 # Main API endpoints
└── package.json            # Dependencies
```

**Key Backend Features:**
- Firebase Functions for serverless API
- Admin SDK for secure operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Automatic enrollment count updates

### Frontend Architecture

### API Integration Strategy

The system uses a **hybrid approach**:
1. **Primary**: Backend API calls for secure operations
2. **Fallback**: Client-side Firebase operations for reliability
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and user feedback

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

1. **Access Admin Dashboard**
   - Navigate to `/admin`
   - View system statistics and management options

2. **Create New Users**
   - Go to `/admin/users/create/new`
   - Fill user details and select courses
   - Choose payment method and complete enrollment

3. **Manage Existing Users**
   - Go to `/admin/users`
   - Click "Manage" on any user
   - View and edit enrollments
   - Update user status and details

4. **Enrollment Management**
   - Go to `/admin/enrollments`
   - Filter and search enrollments
   - Edit enrollment details inline
   - Delete enrollments as needed

### Payment Method Configuration

#### Offline Payment
```javascript
{
  method: "offline",
  amount: 100,
  reference: "BANK_TRANSFER_123",
  paymentDate: "2024-01-15"
}
```

#### Free Enrollment
```javascript
{
  method: "free",
  amount: 0,
  reference: "ADMIN_COMPLIMENTARY"

{
  method: "online",
  amount: 100,
  reference: "ONLINE_PAYMENT_456"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Testing

Run the test suite in browser console:
